Recall that the $L_r^n$\nball is the set $\\{(t_1,t_2,\\dots,t_n);\\ t_i\\in{\\bf R},\\\nn^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n|t_i|^r\\le 1\\}$ and note that for $0<p<q<\\infty$ the $L_q^n$\nball is contained in the $L_p^n$ ball.\n  In Corollary 4 we show that, after normalizing Lebesgue measure so that the\nvolume of the $L_p^n$ ball is one, the answer to the problem above is of order\n$e^{-ct^pn^{p/q}}$ for $T<t<{1\\over 2}n^ {{1\\over p}-{1\\over q}}$, where $c$\nand $T$ depend on $p$ and $q$ but not on $n$.\n  The main theorem, Theorem 3, deals with the corresponding question for the\nsurface measure of the $L_p^n$ sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 1989 15:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
